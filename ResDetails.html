    <h1> About Spice Terrace</h1>
    <p>There can never be too many North Indian restaurants, especially in Bengaluru, where the city-dwellers simply adore the curries. Be it creamy butter chicken or melt-in-your-mouth kebabs, Bengaluru loves it all. To get their curry fix the foodies often flock to the city’s several wonderful restaurants as there are so many, but for an experience like no other, there is only one place that qualifies. JW Marriott’s spectacular North Indian restaurant ‘Spice Terrace’ is an exceptional place in every regard, be it the stunning ambience or the lip-smacking menu. It is one of the loveliest restaurants in Bengaluru and is highly sought after by the glittery set so there is a chance of you catching a sight of some local celebrity dining here. This is truly Bengaluru at its best!

        Quite aptly named Spice Terrace takes you on a flavourful journey across India. Its menu delves into the depth of North Indian cuisine under the brilliant hands of Chef Abdul Quddus, whose vast experience leads you on a trail of great food. Expect to see some classics as well as some unusual suspects on the menu. The food pairs beautifully with wine, ask for a glass or stick to what you love best if you so feel inclined. Watch out for the seafood preparations! Embark on the journey with, gilawat ulta tawa, til pudina malai paneer tikka, salim raan, pomfret sarson methi, rajmah naeyojae tey khoye di tikki, murgh ambada seekh and durust saron lobster. For second course pick, subz tawa, kukad dhaba da, sukka gosht marcheri, adraki aloo gobhi, nalli khaas, kadhai jheenga, paneer kalimirch and lagan ki pasliyan boti. Soak the curries with saunfiya khamiri or makhni naan. The dessert section exudes the same affluence seen in rest of the menu. Get ready to gain some delicious calories with Spice Terrace’s divine desserts such as, jamun khaas, ras malai, shahi balai tukda, phirni, falooda kulfi, gajarela and badaam da halwa. Spice Terrace is an expensive place to dine but one look at its ambience will set your anxiety at rest. The restaurant is sprawled partially by the swimming pool with another beautifully decorated covered seating area. We recommend you to sit by the pool, it’s quite romantic. The best time to visit is in the evenings when the place comes alive with lights and live music.</p>
